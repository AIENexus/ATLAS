# ATLAS

The term Atlas traditionally refers to a collection of related maps - a Narrative Information Management Atlas (referred to here as an ATLAS) is a specialized wiki tool intended to offer easier navigation of the abstract terrain of a given area of knowledge. It uses a community contribution system to structure highly subjective information into codified, modular blocks that allow the knowledge base to be rapidly “re-rendered” or tailored to a particular use-case, research interest, or level of expertise.

The goal of this experimental build is to crowdsource the development of a cognitive security field guide, something between a textbook and a specialized encyclopedia within a year, by drawing from a variety of communities working on similar topics - some with their own ATLAS objects.

An ATLAS consists of 9 core types of objects:

| Name	| Summary |
|:-------|:---------|
| Contributors | Contributors submit modular blocks of information. |
| Agendas | Requests, calls for collaborators, and initiatives. | 
| Resources | External Materials which provide more information and context. | 
| Patterns | Patterns are defined regularities within the environment. | 
| Entities | Entities provide stable reference to abstract objects and concepts. | 
| Questions | Questions posed by or to the community. | 
| Claims | Meaningful points of fact relevant to the community. | 
| Tools | Tools which enhance or enable tradecraft.  | 
| GATs | Glossary items, acronyms, and terms of art used. | 

Functionality of each of these objects is being rolled out slowly here as a part of an experimental build of the system using Coda.io. Blue represents semi-stable implementation, green represents testing, and red represents in design or in the process of implementation. 

Each of these objects can have a variety of “decorators” that allow for more specific descriptions within the context of a particular community - allowing all communities which use an ATLAS to have the same core functionality to trade in requests, resources, and pattern definitions, without requiring everyone having to use identical standards. 

For example, COGSEC’s ATLAS has its own agenda types, such as Collection of Cognitive Phenomena objects, but these are just decorators on the core Agenda object. Where we focus on cognitive phenomena related to Cognitive Security, another community might focus on cognitive phenomena specifically related to conflict resolution, or addiction - they might call their decorated objects something else or give them additional attributes - but we can still trade.
